Abstract = {{Proliferative kidney disease (PKD), caused by the PKX myxosporean, was
   observed in kokanee salmon (non-anadromous sockeye salmon) (Oncorhynchus
   nerka) and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) collected from the Puntledge
   River, Vancouver Island, British Columbia in July 1993. This is the
   first report of a natural infection of PKX in either captive or wild
   sockeye salmon. All 14 underyearling kokanee salmon and the one
   underyearling chinook salmon exhibited numerous PKX organisms and
   associated chronic inflammation in the renal interstitium. Thirty-eight
   percent of sexually mature kokanee salmon collected in the autumn of
   1993 from Comox Lake (which drains into the Puntledge River) were
   infected with Sphaerospora oncorhynchi, Kent, Whitaker and Margolis,
   1993 in the renal tubules, while immature cutthroat trout (O. clarki)
   and coho salmon (O. kisutch) from the same collection did not exhibit
   myxosporean spores in the kidney. The kidneys of threespine stickleback
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) collected
   from the Puntledge River during the summer were all infected with a
   Myxobilatus sp., but no organisms suggestive of PKX or Sphaerospora were
   observed. This study further supports the hypothesis that PKX is a
   developmental stage of S. oncorhynchi, which may sporulate only in
   sexually mature salmonids.
   La maladie proliferative du rein, causée par la myxosporidie PKX, a été observée chez des spécimens de kokani (saumon rouge non anadrome) (Oncorhynchus nerka) et de quinnat (O. tshawytscha) prélevés dans la rivière Puntledge, dans l'île de Vancouver, en juillet 1993. C'est la première fois qu'on signale une infection naturelle au PKX chez des saumons sauvages ou en captivité. Les 14 kokanis de moins d'un an et le quinnat du même âge présentaient de nombreux organismes PKX, ainsi que l'inflammation chronique du tissu interstitiel rénal qui est associée à leur présence. Chez les kokanis sexuellement matures prélevés à l'automne 1993 dans le lac Comox (dont la Puntledge est l'exutoire), 38% étaient infectés par Sphaerospora oncorhynchi Kent, Whitaker et Margolis, 1993 dans les tubules rénaux, tandis que les immatures de truite fardée (O. clarki) et de coho (O. kisutch) prélevés en même temps ne présentaient pas de spores de myxosporidies dans les reins. Les reins des épinoches à trois épines (Gasterosteus aculeatus) et des chabots piquants (Cottus asper) recueillis dans la Puntledge pendant l'été étaient tous infectés par un Myxobilatus sp., mais aucun organisme ressemblant au PKX ou au Sphaerospora n'a été observé. Notre étude vient conforter l'hypothèse selon laquelle le PKX serait un stade de développement de S. oncorhynchi, qui semble ne sporuler que chez les salmonidés sexuellement matures.

abstract = {Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is a temperature-dependent disease caused by the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. It is an emerging threat to wild brown trout Salmo trutta fario populations in Switzerland. Here we examined (1) how PKD prevalence and pathology in young-of-the-year (YOY) brown trout relate to water temperature, (2) whether wild brown trout can completely recover from T. bryosalmonae-induced renal lesions and eliminate T. bryosalmonae over the winter months, and (3) whether this rate and/or extent of the recovery is influenced by concurrent infection. A longitudinal field study on a wild brown trout cohort was conducted over 16 mo. YOY and age 1+ fish were sampled from 7 different field sites with various temperature regimes, and monitored for infection with T. bryosalmonae and the nematode Raphidascaris acus. T. bryosamonae was detectable in brown trout YOY from all sampling sites, with similar renal pathology, independent of water temperature. During winter months, recovery was mainly influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent infection with R. acus larvae. While brown trout without R. acus regenerated completely, concurrently infected brown trout showed incomplete recovery, with chronic renal lesions and incomplete translocation of T. bryosalmonae from the renal interstitium into the tubular lumen. Water temperature seemed to influence complete excretion of T. bryosalmonae, with spores remaining in trout from summer-warm rivers, but absent in trout from summer-cool rivers. In the following summer months, we found PKD infections in 1+ brown trout from all investigated river sites. The pathological lesions indicated a re-infection rather than a proliferation of remaining T. bryosalmonae. However, disease prevalence in 1+ trout was lower than in YOY.},

abstract = {Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is an emerging disease threatening wild salmonid populations. In temperature-controlled aquaria, PKD can cause mortality rates of up to 85\% in rainbow trout. So far, no data about PKD-related mortality in wild brown trout Salmo trutta fario are available. The aim of this study was to investigate mortality rates and pathology in brown trout kept in a cage within a natural river habitat known to harbor Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. Young-of-the-year (YOY) brown trout, free of T. bryosalmonae, were exposed in the River Wutach, in the northeast of Switzerland, during 3 summer months. Samples of wild brown trout caught by electrofishing near the cage location were examined in parallel. The incidence of PKD in cage-exposed animals (69\%) was not significantly different to the disease prevalence of wild fish (82 and 80\% in the upstream and downstream locations, respectively). The mortality in cage-exposed animals, however, was as low as 15\%. At the termination of the exposure experiment, surviving fish showed histological lesions typical for PKD regression, suggesting that many YOY brown trout survive the initial infection. Our results at the River Wutach suggest that PKD in brown trout does not always result in high mortality under natural conditions$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Proliferative kidney disease is a parasitic infection of salmonid fishes caused by Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. The main target organ of the parasite in the fish is the kidney. To investigate the influence of water temperature on the disease in fish, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss infected with T bryosalmonae were kept at 12 degrees C and 18 degrees C. The number of parasites, the type and degree of lesions in the kidney and the mortality rate was evaluated from infection until full development of disease. While mortality stayed low at 12 degrees C, it reached 77\% at 18 degrees C. At 12 degrees C, pathological lesions were dominated by a multifocal proliferative and granulomatous interstitial nephritis. This was accompanied by low numbers of T. bryosalmonae, mainly located in the interstitial lesions. With progression of the disease, small numbers of parasites appeared in the excretory tubuli, and parasite DNA was detected in the urine. Parasite degeneration in the interstitium was observed at late stages of the disease. At 18 degrees C, pathological lesions in kidneys were more severe and more widely distributed, and accompanied by significantly higher parasite numbers. Distribution of parasites in the renal compartments, onset of parasite degeneration and time course of appearance of parasite DNA in urine were not clearly different from the 12 degrees C group. These findings indicate that higher mortality at 18 degrees C compared to 12 degrees C is associated with an enhanced severity of renal pathology and increased parasite numbers.},

Biochemical, histological, and organismal responses as well as parasite abundances were monitored and then analyzed using multivariate analyses. Stress responses in trout induced by the water quality of the river upstream of the STW were enhanced by the discharge of the STW. For caged fish, the serum chemistry values alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, as well as histological indices of gills and liver, were most effective at distinguishing among fish held in river water, a mixture of river water and wastewater, and tap water. For wild fish, total protein, histological liver alterations and abundance of two parasites (sessile peritrichia, Sphaerospora sp.) were the most indicative parameters for discriminating the health of fish between sites upstream and downstream of the STW. Considering the relationships between the measured parameters concurrently, the multivariate discriminant analysis is an effective method to evaluate which combination of parameters provide the best discrimination between the treatment groups. In contrast to the calculation of group differences based on individual responses, the integrated responses of parameters representing different biological levels lead to a more comprehensive assessment of organismal health and a more accurate distinction in differences between treatment groups.",

For our study we have chosen a river in the Swiss midlands, where the brown trout population has decreased dramatically during the last 10 yr and where feral fish have shown distinctive pathological alterations. The objective of our study was to investigate whether river water may be responsible for impaired fish health leading to an increased mortality in the river. In an active monitoring program, groups of brown and rainbow trout were exposed to polluted river water for 24 mo. Fish held in tap water served as a reference. Mortality, macroscopic and histopathologic changes, and infectious agents were investigated. Compared with the reference group, high mortality rates and severe pathological alterations of the inner organs were observed in fish held in river water. Especially gills, liver and kidney of these fish showed significantly higher changes than fish from tap water. These changes were dominated by degenerative and inflammatory reactions. Additionally, several infectious agents were diagnosed in fish exposed to river water. The most important findings were furunculosis and proliferative kidney disease. Brown trout seemed to be more sensitive than rainbow trout to environmental stress and infectious agents.},

abstract = {Chlordecone (CLD) is an organochlorine insecticide abundant in aquatic environment of the French West Indies. However, few studies have investigated its impact on freshwater invertebrates. Whereas CLD is suspected of inducing endocrine disruption, this work aimed to study the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of CLD on the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) hormone concentration and on the chitobiase activity, both having key roles in the molting process of crustaceans. In addition, the bioaccumulation of CLD was measured in the muscle tissue of Macrobrachium rosenbergii to underline potential dose-response relationship. The results have shown that CLD was bioaccumulated in exposed organisms according to a trend to a dose-response relationship. Moreover, it was observed that CLD decreased the 20-HE concentration in exposed prawns when compared to control, whatever the duration of exposure, as well as it inhibited the chitobiase activity after 30 days of exposure. The present study indicates that CLD could interfere with molting process of M. rosenbergii by disturbing the 20-HE concentration and the activity of chitobiase, suggesting consequences at the long term on the shrimp development. This study also confirmed that CLD could be an endocrine disruptor in decapod crustaceans, as it was already observed in vertebrates.},

abstract = {During the last 50 years, agricultural intensification has caused many wild plant and animal species to go extinct regionally or nationally and has profoundly changed the functioning of agro-ecosystems. Agricultural intensification has many components, such as loss of landscape elements, enlarged farm and field sizes and larger inputs of fertilizer and pesticides. However, very little is known about the relative contribution of these variables to the large-scale negative effects on biodiversity. In this study, we disentangled the impacts of various components of agricultural intensification on species diversity of wild plants, carabids and ground-nesting farmland birds and on the biological control of aphids. In a Europe-wide study in eight West and East European countries, we found important negative effects of agricultural intensification on wild plant, carabid and bird species diversity and on the potential for biological pest control, as estimated from the number of aphids taken by predators. Of the 13 components of intensification we measured, use of insecticides and fungicides had consistent negative effects on biodiversity. Insecticides also reduced the biological control potential. Organic farming and other agri-environment schemes aiming to mitigate the negative effects of intensive farming on biodiversity did increase the diversity of wild plant and carabid species, but - contrary to our expectations - not the diversity of breeding birds. We conclude that despite decades of European policy to ban harmful pesticides, the negative effects of pesticides on wild plant and animal species persist, at the same time reducing the opportunities for biological pest control. If biodiversity is to be restored in Europe and opportunities are to be created for crop production utilizing biodiversity-based ecosystem services such as biological pest control, there must be a Europe-wide shift towards farming with minimal use of pesticides over large areas. ?? 2009 Gesellschaft f??r ??kologie.},

Some major long-term threats to the aquatic biota are chronic pollution in estuarine and coastal areas originating from the land, and oil spills and seeps from tankers and drilling rigs offshore. A pollutant acting alone might not necessarily be harmful but in combination with others could induce stress. During the past decade, it has been increasingly clear that several fish diseases and abnormalities occur with increased prevalence in wild fish populations in highly polluted areas. While it has been difficult to relate concentrations of specific pollutants in water and sediments directly to disease, there are indications of such a connection in some organisms. Thus, pollutants might influence, directly or indirectly, the prevalence, intensity, and pathogenicity of a parasite. This chapter reviews present knowledge of this relationship. In attempting to do so, it examines how some different aquatic pollutants enter and affect the fish, which constitute the microhabitat of the parasites. It also describes a series of published and unpublished studies concerned with the influence of pollutants on ecto- and endoparasites of aquatic organisms. It provides suggestions for areas in need of further research. "

Robert Poulin discusses the many ways in which toxic pollution may affect infections of metazoan parasited in freshwater fish. Efects on fish immunity, parasites survival and intermediate host populations are not independent, and currently the outcome of toxic pollution and parasitism in fish is impossible to predict.

This paper presents data on patterns of occurrence of T. bryosalmonae and sequence variation among isolates. T. bryosalmonae infects bryozoans that range from primitive to more derived genera within the Phylactolaemata and that differ in growth form and habits. Infected bryozoans have been collected in diverse habitats including cold, clear streams and warm, eutrophic lakes. Temporal surveys reveal intra- and interannual variation in infection levels, and spatial variation in incidence of infection is implicit by the apparent absence of T. bryosalmonae from many bryozoan populations. The significance of minor variation in partial sequences of 18S RDNA requires further investigation. The information presented here provides the first significant insights into the ecology of T. bryosalmonae.},

@article{Hartikainen2009,
abstract = {P>1. The hypothesis that nutrient enrichment will affect bryozoan abundance was tested using two complementary investigations; a field-based method determining bryozoan abundance in 20 rivers of different nutrient concentrations by deploying statoblast (dormant propagule) traps and an experimental laboratory microcosm study measuring bryozoan growth and mortality. These two methods confirmed independently that increased nutrient concentrations in water promote increases in the biomass of freshwater bryozoans. 2. Statoblasts of the genus Plumatella were recorded in all rivers, regardless of nutrient concentrations, demonstrating that freshwater bryozoans are widespread. Concentrations of Plumatella statoblasts were high in rivers with high nutrient concentrations relative to those with low to moderate nutrient concentrations. Regression analyses indicated that phosphorus concentrations, in particular, significantly influenced statoblast concentrations. 3. Concentrations of Lophopus crystallinus statoblasts were also higher in sites characterised by high nutrient concentrations. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of L. crystallinus statoblasts was significantly associated with decreasing altitude and increasing phosphorus concentrations. This apparently rare species was found in nine rivers (out of 20), seven of which were new sites for L. crystallinus. 4. Growth rates of Fredericella sultana in laboratory microcosms increased with increasing nutrient concentration and high mortality rates were associated with low nutrient concentrations. 5. Our results indicate that bryozoans respond to increasing nutrient concentrations by increased growth, resulting in higher biomasses in enriched waters. We also found that an important component of bryozoan diets can derive from food items lacking chlorophyll a. Finally, bryozoans may be used as independent proxies for inferring trophic conditions, a feature that may be especially valuable in reconstructing historical environments by assessing the abundance of statoblasts in sediment cores.},

@book{Khan1991,
abstract = {We have tried to draw attention to an increasing body of evidence (from several publications) that parasites of fish might be useful indicators of pollution. Several types of pollutants, including domestic sewage, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, heavy metals, pulp and paper effluents, petroleum aromatic hydrocarbons, acid rain, and others, are known to affect aquatic animals. Many of the latter are parasitized and, under natural environmental conditions, most fish parasites are believed to cause little or no harm. However, chronic exposure to pollutants over a period of time causes biochemical, physiological and behavioural host changes that ultimately can influence the prevalence and intensity of parasitism. Some of these changes include host nutrition, growth and reproduction. Macroscopic lesions might not always be apparent, but subtle disorders in several specific tissues and organs might occur. Pollutants might promote increased parasitism in aquatic animals, especially fish, by impairing the host's immune response or favouring the survival and reproduction of the intermediate hosts. Alternatively, decreased parasitism might ensue through toxicity of the pollutant to free-living stages and intermediate hosts or by alteration of the host's physiology. Experimental studies indicate that the numbers of ectoparasites such as trichodinid ciliates and monogeneans increase significantly on the gills following exposure to a pollutant, and this is supported by field data on other ciliates and monogeneans where evidence of pollution has been clearly demonstrated. There is also evidence that endoparasitic protozoons, such as myxozoons, microsporans and haematozoons, all of which are capable of proliferating in their hosts, increase substantially in prevalence and intensity when interacting with pollutants. The period of patency might also be prolonged in haematozoan infections. Most reports of pollution effects on endoparasites suggest increased parasitism in fish hosts. This also applies to fish living in areas which receive thermal effluents. Parasites might in turn enhance their hosts' susceptibility to pollutants, and information in support of this view is accumulating. Finally, immunosuppression represents one of the underlying mechanisms influencing increased parasitism. Thus, while published information suggests more than a casual connection between fish parasites and pollution, further research is needed to establish the cause-and-effect relationship and at the same time take cognizance of histopathological effects of the toxic agents and their concentrations in water. Areas for future research are recommended.},

abstract = {Aim†The transport of organisms in ships' ballast tanks is a dominant vector for aquatic invasions worldwide. Until recently, efforts to manage this vector have overlooked the potential transport of invertebrate resting stages in the residual waters and sediments within emptied ballast tanks, i.e. NOBOB ('No Ballast On Board') tanks. The resting stages (statoblasts) of freshwater bryozoans are often buoyant and locally abundant and thus can be taken up easily during ballasting operations. They are also resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can generate new colonies after being dormant for decades; as such, they would likely remain viable propagules after lengthy transport in ship ballast tanks. This study quantified the occurrence of freshwater bryozoan statoblasts in ballast tank sediments of transoceanic ships.Location† North American Great Lakes.Methods† We quantified the frequency of occurrence, abundance and diversity of bryozoans (as statoblasts) in residual sediment samples taken from 51 NOBOB tanks of 33 transoceanic ships visiting the Great Lakes from 2000 to 2002.Results† Our study identified 11 species, comprising nearly 12\% of the total number of freshwater bryozoans known worldwide. These include two exotic species unrecorded in the Great Lakes (Fredericella sultana and Lophopus crystallinus), an exotic species already established in the region (Lophopodella carteri) and three cosmopolitan species (Plumatella casmiana, P.†fungosa and P.†repens). Our estimates suggest that a ship with NOBOB tanks may carry up to 106†statoblasts.Main conclusions† The discovery of species unrecorded in the Great Lakes and the potentially large numbers of statoblasts being transported in ship ballast tanks indicate a significant risk of new species introductions. Furthermore, the presence of cosmopolitan species and an exotic species already established in the Great Lakes suggests the strong possibility of cryptic invasions via the introduction of exotic genotypes.},

abstract = {Differences in susceptibility to the myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD), between four strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) were evaluated. Fish were exposed to water enzootic for the parasite in the field for 5 days and were subsequently transferred to the laboratory. Relative parasite load was determined after 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-exposure (wpe) by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of kidney samples and number of parasite stages was determined in immunohistochemical stained sections of kidney, liver and spleen tissues. According to qPCR results, the highest amount of parasite DNA per equal amount of host tissue at all time points was measured in brown trout. Two of the rainbow trout strains showed lower relative parasite load than all other groups at the beginning of the experiment, but the parasite multiplied faster in these strains resulting in an equal level of relative parasite load for all rainbow trout strains at 4 wpe. A weak negative correlation of fish size and parasite load was detected. Only in samples of a few fish, single stages of T. bryosalmonae were found in sections stained by immunohistochemistry impeding quantitative evaluation of parasite numbers by this method. The results indicate a differential resistance to T. bryosalmonae between the rainbow trout strains investigated and between rainbow trout and brown trout. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Because spores that develop in bryozoan colonies are infectious to fish, bryozoans represent the ultimate source of PKD. Bryozoans produce numerous seed-like dormant stages called statoblasts that enable persistence during unfavourable conditions and achieve long-distance dispersal. The possibility that T. bryosalmonae may undergo vertical transmission via infection of statoblasts has been the subject of much speculation since this is observed in close relatives. This study provides the first evidence that such vertical transmission of T. bryosalmonae is extensive by examining the proportions of infected statoblasts in populations of F. sultana on two different rivers systems and confirms its effectiveness by demonstrating transmission from material derived from infected statoblasts t" # "o fish hosts. Vertical transmission in statoblasts is likely to play an important role in the infection dynamics of both bryozoan and fish hosts and may substantially contribute to the widespread distribution of PKD.",

Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae was successfully transmitted from infected brown trout, Salmo trutta L., to newly hatched F. sultana colonies in BMC, then from the infected bryozoan to SPF brown trout. This study demonstrated the utility of BMC (pH 6.65) for hatching statoblasts, long-term cultivation of clean and transparent bryozoan colonies and maintenance of the Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae life cycle in the laboratory for molecular genetic research and other studies such as host-parasiteinteraction.},

abstract = {The myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD), a highly damaging disease of cultured salmonid fish. Within this study, phylactolaemate bryozoans were collected from a river known to be endemic for PKD and subsequently cultured in the laboratory. Sequential developmental stages of T. bryosalmonae were studied by light microscopy within the living bryozoan colonies, allowing the identification of stages attached to host peritoneum, consistent with previous molecular evidence of cryptic stages. Infection resulted in the production of large numbers of spores, which were released from the bryozoans. Experimental exposure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to medium in which infected bryozoans were cultured resulted in clinical PKD. Rainbow trout were exposed to known numbers of T. bryosalmonae spores collected by micromanipulation, which had been released from mature spore sacs within colonies of the bryozoan Fredericella sultana. Exposure to one spore was sufficient to lead to development of PKD. These findings indicate that small numbers of bryozoans are capable of releasing sufficient spores to infect large numbers of fish, having implications for future control methods for PKD in salmonid farming. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The myxozoan, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, exploits freshwater bryozoans as definitive hosts, occurring as cryptic stages in bryozoan colonies during covert infections and as spore-forming sacs during overt infections. Spores released from sacs are infective to salmonid fish, causing the devastating Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD). We undertook laboratory studies using mesocosm systems running at 10, 14 and 20 ??C to determine how infection by T. bryosalmonae and water temperature influence fitness of one of its most important bryozoan hosts, Fredericella sultana, over a period of 4 weeks. The effects of infection were context-dependent and often undetectable. Covert infections appear to pose very low energetic costs. Thus, we found that growth of covertly infected F. sultana colonies was similar to that of uninfected colonies regardless of temperature, as was the propensity to produce dormant resting stages (statoblasts). Production of statoblasts, however, was associated with decreased growth. Overt infections imposed greater effects on correlates of host fitness by: (i) reducing growth rates at the two higher temperatures; (ii) increasing mortality rates at the highest temperature; (iii) inhibiting statoblast production. Our results indicate that parasitism should have a relatively small effect on host fitness in the field as the negative effects of infection were mainly expressed in environmentally extreme conditions (20 ??C for 4 weeks). The generally low virulence of T. bryosalmonae is similar to that recently demonstrated for another myxozoan endoparasite of freshwater bryozoans. The unique opportunity for extensive vertical transmission in these colonial invertebrate hosts couples the reproductive interests of host and parasite and may well give rise to the low virulence that characterises these systems. Our study implies that climate change can be expected to exacerbate PKD outbreaks and increase the geographic range of PKD as a result of the combined responses of T. bryosalmonae and its bryozoan hosts to higher temperatures.

Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brown trout Salmo trutta, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, grayling Thymallus thymallus and northern pike Esox lucius were cohabitated with T. bryosalmonae-infected Fredericella sultana colonies and then subsequently cohabitated with statoblast-reared parasite free Bryozoa. Statoblasts from infected colonies were tested by PCR to detect cryptic stages of T. bryosalmonae, which may indicate vertical transmission of the parasite. In this study, brown trout and brook trout were able to infect Bryozoa, while there was no evidence that rainbow trout and grayling were able to do so. Few interstitial kidney stages of the parasite were detected by immunohistochemistry in brown trout and brook trout, while rainbow trout and grayling showed marked proliferation of renal interstitial tissue and macrophages with numerous parasite cells. Intraluminal stages in the kidney tubules were only detected in brown trout and rainbow trout. In contrast to previous observations, pike was not susceptible to PKD in these trials according to the results of T. bryosalmonae-specific PCR. No DNA of T. bryosalmonae was detected in any statoblast.},

The role of salmonid fish in the life-cycle of this parasite has been conjectured upon for over a quarter of a century. To examine whether fish can transmit the infection to bryozoans, the known invertebrate host, water containing parasitized brown trout Salmo trutta was pumped into tanks containing colonies of Fredericella sultana collected from the wild. The specific parasite-free status of these colonies being first assessed, by PCR and prolonged laboratory culture. After 6 weeks exposure to the brown trout aquarium effluent, portions of these colonies displayed overt infections with T. bryosalmonae. This was in contrast to control bryozoans, derived from the experimental colonies prior to exposure, which remained T. bryosalmonae negative. In addition, spores obtained from the experimentally infected colonies were exposed to na{\"{i}}ve rainbow trout, resulting in clinical PKD, thus completing a cycle of transmission. During the experiments, the infection was noted to inhibit statoblast formation within bryozoans and appeared to be pathogenic, finally killing the bryozoan host. These findings indicate that fish can transmit the parasite to bryozoans and are an integral part of this parasite's life-cycle.},

Colonies were deployed in the field for 8 trial periods of 2 wk each throughout the summer of 2001. Following each trial, bryozoan colonies were maintained in laboratory culture for 28 d and were regularly monitored for infection by searching for sac stages of T. bryosalmonae. Infections were never identified by observations of sac stages, however positive PCR results and sequencing of cultured material confirmed that cryptic infections were present in colonies of both species deployed at one site. The possibility that PCR results reflected contamination of surfaces of bryozoans can be excluded, given the short period of spore viability of T. bryosalmonae. Highest rates of infection occurred when 4 of 23 colonies of F. sultana and 1 of 12 colonies of P. fungosa were infected during the period 10 to 24 July. No infections were detected from mid-August to late October at this site. None of the colonies at the other site became infected throughout the period of study. Our data provide the first estimates of infection rates of bryozoans by T. bryosalmonae. Additionally, they provide evidence that a cryptic stage can be maintained within bryozoan hosts for a period of 4 to 6 wk.},

abstract = {Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) poses a high financial burden upon the freshwater salmonid aquaculture industry of Europe and North America. The alternate hosts of the causative agent, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Myxozoa: Malacosporea), have been identified as freshwater bryozoans (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata) within which spores capable of infecting salmonid fish develop. Currently, control of PKD relies upon complex management practices, with no licensed prophylaxis or treatment available. Assessment of the nutritional preferences of phylactolaemate bryozoans allowed development of an optimised laboratory culture system. Following laboratory maintenance, bryozoans collected from PKD-endemic sites were found to be infected with the malacosporean parasites T. bryosalmonae and Buddenbrockia plumatellae. Subsequent parasitic development was observed using light-, electron- and confocal-microscopy techniques. Methods of challenging rainbow trout with T. bryosalmonae spores were developed, with the minimum infective dose established. The presence of Thomsen-Friedenreich and Tn epitopes within the parasite was investigated, and experimental vaccine preparations based on either these specificities or T. bryosalmonae-infected bryozoans were efficacy tested in rainbow trout. In addition, salinomycin and amprolium were tested as prospective chemotherapeutants for PKD. Further insights into the development and subsequent release of malacosporean spores within their invertebrate hosts have been revealed. Long-term maintenance of T. bryosalmonae allowed controlled infection of rainbow trout previously vaccinated with experimental preparations. Findings of the project could potentially be utilised in future research into the development of control methods for PKD.},
